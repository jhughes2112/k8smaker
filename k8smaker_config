# You cannot change this value after creating the cluster.  So it should always be a name not an IP.
# BareMetal: Leave it alone.  Ideally, add control-nodes as a DNS entry so it resolves properly, but
# if not, we patch /etc/hosts to point control-nodes to the CONTROLPLANEVIP manually on each node.
# This is the software loade balanced vIP address.  Works fine whether you have 1 or more control nodes.
# AWS: Put the actual name of your internal control plane load balancer here, if you plan
# to use one.  Otherwise leave it alone.  You can always come back and sub in the LB's IP address
# but those sometimes change without notice, so YMMV.
